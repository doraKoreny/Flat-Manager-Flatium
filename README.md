# Flat-Manager-Flatium
The purpose of this project was to learn how to design and implement an enterprise level product with REST APIs. 

## About the project
We planned to create an application that can make those people's life easier who live in a flat. It can be useful not only for the residental, but for the landlord as well. If your building is registered in our database, you can register yourself and your flat as well. After you logged in, you can find every important information about your building: residental meet-up date, garbage-collecting time, phone number of the landlord or doctor etc. You can also check your flat data and your unpayed bills. Residentals can also share important information with each other on the forum page.  

## General requirements
- creating an enterprise level product
- use Spring Boot
- use dependency injection
- write unit tests
- the backend and frontend codebase should sit in different folders

## Used technologies
- Spring Boot
- PostgreSQL
- Hibernate
- JUnit
- React

## Disclaimer
This is not a finished project. The backend works as intended. In its current form the frontend is partially implemented. 


This is a teamwork project. The Flatium team consists of three amazing Codecoolers: Koreny Dóra, Márton János, Ádám Bozsóki. During the implementation we used pair-programming technique a lot. We spent all together 12 days to implement this application.
